# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
